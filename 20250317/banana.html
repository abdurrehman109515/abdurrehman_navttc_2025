            Bananas are nutrient-rich fruits known for their soft, sweet flesh and easy-to-peel skin. Originating in Southeast Asia, they are a great source of potassium, fiber, and vitamins. Bananas are eaten fresh, blended into smoothies, or used in desserts, making them a staple in diets worldwide.
