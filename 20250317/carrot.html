            Carrots are crunchy, sweet root vegetables rich in beta-carotene, fiber, and vitamins. Originating from Persia, they come in various colors like orange, purple, and yellow. Eaten raw, cooked, or juiced, carrots are popular in salads, soups, and snacks, promoting eye health and overall well-being.
