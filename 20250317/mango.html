            Mangoes, known as the "king of fruits," are tropical delights with a sweet, juicy flavor. Originating in
            South Asia, they come in numerous varieties like Alphonso and Totapuri. Rich in vitamins A and C, mangoes
            are enjoyed fresh, in juices, smoothies, jams, and pickles worldwide.
